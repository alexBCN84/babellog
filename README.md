# README

We introduce here a web app that works around the principle of blogs and social networking to inspire the community and help them with their personal or professional achievements.

Babellog is mainly geared toward serving the purpose of practising writing skills in a given foreign language. Subscribers can create and customise their linguistic profile combined with any other additional information they may want to provide. 

Users may use the draft section to publish their posts for native or more experienced users of that particular language to read and provide feedback:

User1 publishes a post in language A
Post in Language B is open for native and advanced students of Language A to review and provide constructive feedback.

Once User 1 is happy with the result, they can publish their review and updated version in the sample blog, which consists of texts published by students and classified in different levels after having been approved by native or advanced speakers of the language.

More details to come after project completion.
